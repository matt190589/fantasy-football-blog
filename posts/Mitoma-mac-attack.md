Mitoma's and MacAllistair are creating mayhem and racking up the points. It's difficult not to mention 'seventh heaven' with Salah, Gakpo and Nunez romping home with long overdue points. This emphatic win was the first PL match since 1999 where all three forwards scored a brace in the same game. Forest are not mentioned often in FPL conversations but Brennan Johnson is a high quality player that delivers for loyal FPL managers.

- **Gameweek 26**- Arise Sir Mo Salah, as many dropped him in their wildcard week, I kept faith and he very much delivered. I recouped the -4 transfer hit from a great Brighton performance and Mitoma return. The good news continues as I won back-to-back matches in my head to head league and I now trail 17 - 7 overall. My bench is a worry with Sanchez being dropped as Brighton's No 1 and long-term question marks over Nketiah. I'll end on my highlight, I climbed into 3,557,513 place which although not impressive, it marks a rise of 1.4 million places since I started the blog.
- **Looking forward to GW27**- Brentford & Brighton are the pick of the teams in GW27. Many will captain Toney but there is also value to be had in single GW players such as Rashford, Salah and Haaland. All of whom have favourable opponents. It hards to pick between Mitoma, March and MacAllistair and it may be that their scores even out over the two games. For those trying to make up ground in mini-leagues, James Ward-Prowse could be worth the gamble.

- **One's to watch**- With a fun few weeks ahead, Brentford players are a must-have with 5 gives in 3 GWs with Toney at the top of the shooping list. Don't look beyond Ferguson and March at Brighton just because they blank in GW28. They should more than make up for it in GW29. I'll finish on tipping a change of fortunate at Chelsea which will be lead by their wingbacks, Chilwell and Reece James. James may even convert a penalty in the next few weeks.
