Rashford runs riot with a leading Gameweek score of 20 points. A possible missed opportunity for using the Triple Captain chip. Ben Mee is averaging over 7 points a game in his last 5 starts and makes Brentford a formidable team to break down.Arrizabalaga is the only keeper in town at the minute with M & M, Mahrez & Mitoma, leading the way as on form midfielders.

- **Gameweek 22**- A higher than average 72 points helped me continue my green arrow roll but KDB's continued absence is a costly waste of FPL funds. With Man City and Arsenal's DGW in 23, KDB gets one more chance with Almiron likely to make way for Saka in my starting XI. Man City continue to leak goals and Newcastle may be losing form. Willy Gnonto paid off my local loyality and he'll continue to be a danger even if Leeds are managerless.

- **Looking forward to GW23**- Three Arsenal and Three Man City seems like the obvious choice. The one issue is that there is very little differential with this as someone who is chasing the league. Nketiah should continue to hold his place but my worry is Arsenal where uninspiring at Everton and the consistent scoring may be fizzling out.

- **One's to watch** I've focused on mostly attacking assets over the past few weeks but defenses can win trophies. I featured Ben Mee in today's headline but his old Burnley Buddy, James Tarkowski should now be considered with Dyche's influence set to increase Everton's defensive abilities. Fulham are competing in the European places and FPL managers would do well not to look past Ream, Tete or Robinson. Finally, as much as I hate to say it- Luke Shaw is no a MUST HAVE but beware, he is likely to blank in Game Week 25.
