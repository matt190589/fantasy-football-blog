What a difference a gameweek makes. Erling Haaland made up for lost team with his incredible fouth hatrick of the season. Arsenal's tremendous trio of Saka, Odegaard and Nketiah continue their domination and there's to suggest this stopping. The big hitters are delivering but Mitoma, Ferguson and Estupinian all deserve notable mention

- **Gameweek 21** Martinez left on my bench led to a narrow lose in my head-to-head league but choosing Dunk in a 50/50 with Estupinian was all the more painful. Things are looking up as I achieved my third green arrow in three weeks.
- **Looking forward to Gameweek 22** Time is on your side so hold the transfers until the FA cup plays out. Potential cup replays could delay double gameweek prospect for Leeds and Manchester United. The January transfer will close before GW22 kicks off which is worth keeping a watchful eye on. The Newcastle defence cannot be breached but goals have also become harder to come back at the other end. Wilson and Almiron are on our their way out with further fixture analysis needed before transfer

- **One's to watch** Willy Gnonto is the on-form attacking asset at Leeds but Rodrigo offers incredible value in midfield with two games. A non-scoring debut for Mudryk did not go unnoticed. He registered the highest speed of any premier league player this season and will undoubtedly return FPL points on his first starting debut.
