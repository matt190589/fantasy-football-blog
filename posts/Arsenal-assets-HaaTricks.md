What a difference a gameweek makes. Erling Haaland made up his min-purple patch with his incredible fourth hatrick of the season. Arsenal's tremendous trio of Saka, Odegaard and Nketiah continue their domination and there's nothing to suggest this stopping with Arsenal's generous run our games until GW28. The big hitters are delivering but Mitoma, Ferguson and Estupinian all deserve notable mention as Brighton players continue to haul in FPL points.

- **Gameweek 21** Leaving Martinez on my bench led to a narrow lose in my head-to-head league but choosing Dunk in a 50/50 with Estupinian was all the more painful. However, things are looking up as I achieved my third green arrow in three weeks.
- **Looking forward to Gameweek 22** Time is on your side so hold the transfers until the FA cup plays out. Potential cup replays could delay the double gameweek prospect for Leeds and Manchester United. The January transfer will close before GW22 kicks off which is worth keeping a watchful eye on. The Newcastle defence cannot be breached but goals have also become harder to come back at the other end. Wilson and Almiron are on our their way out with further fixture analysis needed before final transfer decisions.

- **One's to watch** Willy Gnonto is the on-form attacking asset at Leeds but Rodrigo offers incredible value in midfield with two games in GW22. Lord Bamford is also set to return to the starting XI. A non-scoring substitute appearance for Mudryk did not go unnoticed. He registered the highest speed of any Premier League player this season and will undoubtedly return FPL points on his first starting debut.
