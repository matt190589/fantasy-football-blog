Trossard three assists made him the highest scoring player in GW26 with his teammate, Gabriel on slightly behind him scoring 14 points. Toney, Mitoma and March all delivered in their captaincy roles. Jack Harrison was involved in all areas of the pitch and returned a favourable 11pts. On the less-than-impressive list this week is last week's hero Mo Salah with huge 0 points against Bournemouth. What a difference a few days make in football!

- **Gameweek 27**- On the up and up, I risked an 8 point hit but was rewarded with 87 points this week which rewards me with another green arrow and a few places clawed back in mini-leagues. I transfered in Chilwell and couldn't quite decide what do with him. However, this transfer will payout in the coming weeks. My transfer policy has been speculate to accummulate with points and this is something I intend to continue.

- **Looking forward to GW28**- A few weeks ago, I asked 'What's happened to Haaland?'. Well, he's bounced back brilliantly but is he worth keeping with only one match in GW28 & GW29. Watkins and Kane are the obvious candidates to step up. Many teams will have 8 or 9 players starting in GW28, the key is to balance those missing in GW28 with doubles in GW29. Rashford, Mitoma, March, MacAllister and Estupinian shoudl be held. My advice, create a transfer plan for the next 3 weeks.

- **One's to watch**- Firstly, Toney is one yellow card from a two match suspension which may thwart plans in GW29. I predict a turn of form for Newcastle in the European race which will mean goals for Almiron, Isak and assists for Trippier. Can Maddison turn the tide for Leicester? His underlining xG and xA stats say he can.
