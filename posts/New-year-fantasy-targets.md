An abysmal start to the season has left my team languishing at the bottom or in the relegation zone in most of my mini-leagues. To add to the woes, I'm 12-5 down in a head-to-head league. So the revival must start **here**. It is possible to mount a big comeback in the second half of the season. I'll document my weekly choices and upward trajectory on this blog every week.

- **Gameweek 19** it's time to Dis....Mount, a late transfer decision in GW19 for his double game week (DGW) resulted in a late injury to rule him out for the City game. Captain Mitrovic also sat out the second match with an unnecessary againist Leicester.

- **Targets for the second half of the season** As I hover in a position just outside the top 5mil (5,011,423), I accept that competition for winning mini-leagues this year has passed me by. However, like all managers, form can return and I'm targeting a finish in the overall top 3 million players. Fingers crossed for the green tick future.

- **One's to watch** Every week I'll be sharing a few recommendations on players to watch or players to bring in. These won't be the high value targets such as Haaland, KDB or Kane but will focus more on form and differential value.
