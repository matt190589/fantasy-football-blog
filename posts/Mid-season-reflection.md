An abysmal start to the season has left my team languishing at the bottom or in the relegation zone in most of my mini-leagues. To add to the woes, I'm 12-5 down in a head-to-head league.
So the revival must start **here**. It is possible to mount a big comeback in the second half of the season. I'll document my weekly choices and upward trajectory on this blog every week.

- **Gameweek 19** it's time to Dis....Mount, transfered in to GW19 for his double game resulted in a late injury to rule him out for the city game. Captain Mitrovic sits out the second
- **Looking forward to Gameweek 20** the profilic goal machine has a double game week which gives him the captaincy armband with a strong case for the Triple captain Chip. Apart from KDB, it's impossible to predict how many city players will play both games so I'm avoiding Pep Roulette and saving my transfers for Spurs or Man United players. Harry Kane loves the North London derby and is fond of scoring against the Champions. On the topic of Spurs assets, has Son found his form after dumping his facemask? In form Shaw seems a shrewd investment for the double game week and beyond.

- **One's to watch** the upcoming fixtures of Leeds United should bring opportunities for goals and you should look no further than Rodrigo who has 10 goals this season. Listed as an FPL midfielder will boost the goal points return and bonus points to boot.
