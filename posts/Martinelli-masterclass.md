This week was all about Arsenal with Martinelli punishing yee of little faith and loyalty. Saka, Odegaard, Zinchenko, White, Saliba and TAA all delivered double figures. Van Dijk wins defender of the week and Junior Firpo scored highest of the single game players. Foden and Haaland popped up to score for Man City and many FPL managers.

- **Gameweek 25**- Salah captaincy was a middle of the road choice with more value in Saka. A chance on Sarabia worked out but Mykolenko was points down the pan. My highest total of the season helped me climb into the top 4 million FPL managers. A big congratulations to Anna on taking a commanding lead in the family mini-league. My final thought on my team is--- how can I overcome this struggling defence and goalkeeper!

- **Looking forward to GW26**- You need to be thinking ahead to GW27 but how many transfer points are you willing to exchange for this planning. I've gone early and will reveal my transfers are Sarabia/Bueno OUT for Mitoma/Henry IN. There is future thinking in mind with expected player pricee rises. The differential for GW26 will be decided on Captain choice. Strong cases can be made for Saka, Rashford and Haaland with high all three likely to score this weekend.

- **One's to watch**- It's not players that I will feature this week. It's Game Weeks(GWs) that you should be keeping an eye on. In the next five weeks, there will be many double GWs interpersed with a few blanks along the way. Four teams will double in GW27 with 12 teams doubling in GW29. These doubles are sandwiched with six teams blanking in GW28. The question every FPL manager needs to consider, is Toney worth the gamble?
