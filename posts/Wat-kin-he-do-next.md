The DGW assets delivered with Mitoma, Watkins, Rashford, Trippier and Martinez a selection of many who achieved double digits. This week's MVP was Callum Wilson who played only 90 minutes across his two games. The form teams bouncing into the next few weeks are Newcastle, Man City, Aston Villa and the mighty Leeds United.

- **Gameweek 29**-
- **Looking forward to GW30**- There's one man's fitness that every manager is waiting on... Erling Haaland. Will he back for the Southamption match? I'm gambling he will be and have transfered the one-week failure Ings out and brought Haaland straight back in. A Luke Shaw injury means pondering another transfer with Villa defenders at the top of the list.

- **One's to watch**- The next week to think about is GW32 when there'll be no Man City, United, Brighton or Chelsea in GW32. A strategy to field a full XI in that week and takee advantage of Man City and Brighton's attacking assets. With only 9 weeks left to play, now is thee time to plan out your remaining chip strategy as this could be thee difference in your mini-leagues. GW32 or GW34 are perfect for a free hit, GW34 or GW37 could be ideal for a bench boost or Triple Captain. If you're fortunate enough still to have your wildcard, GW33 is the optimal choice to prime your team for the final 5 games.
