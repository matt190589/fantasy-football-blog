What Haaland can do in 25 minutes takes most players two matches. Many managers gave him the armband and he delivered in his first-half cameo. It was the forwards who took the headlines this week, with Watkins, Jota, and Solanke hauling in the big points. Leeds' leaky defense helped Mo Salah to a charitable 14 points, and Eze was the Palace player in form with two wonderful solo goals.

- **Gameweek 31**- Maintining the charge up the FF league tables, and for the first time this season, I've climbed into 2nd place in my family league. Progress isn't swift, but rising inside the top 2.5 million keeps me on track. I need to pick up 60,000 places every week to jump into the top 2 million. My early move for Alex Moreno is reaping rewards and adding that extra needed price value to my team.

- **Looking forward to GW33**- After saving a transfer in GW31, I have the luxury of fielding a starting XI without needing to use a chip. This includes a transfer of Marcus Rashford, who will make way for a temporary replacement. Chilwell has been replaced by Robertson. The big difference will be made by your captain choice. I'm swaying towards Martinelli, as many others will be, but Toney is certainly not out of the question. I need to do more research before confirming my captain choice at 6 PM on Friday.

- **One's to watch**- The next week to pin in your diary is GW34. It's time to think about putting out a full starting XI, all with double fixtures. The spine of that team needs to include Alisson, Estupinan, Mitoma/March, Rashford and Haaland. The rest of your team will determine whether you climb or fall and how much you're willing to gamble. Another statistic of note is that Brigthon have 9 fixtures to squeeze into the remaining 6 GWs.
