A woeful second half performance by Leeds propelled Jordan Ayew and Olise to the top of the FPL charts. At the top of the league, Haaland returned with his usual double figure haul and Martinelli broke a Brazilian scoring record in the Premier League. The big guns are firing and I don't see this stopping. With Watkins scoring streak continuing, FPL managers should be frontloading their attacks!

- **Gameweek 31**- A high scoring week but not as much movemnet as many would expect.

- **Looking forward to GW33**- After saving a transfer in GW31, this allows me to field a starting XI with many players missing. This includes marcus Rashford who will make way for a temporarily replacement. Chilwell has been binned for Robertson. The big difference will be made by the captain choice. I've swayed towards Martinelli as many will be but Toney is certainly not out of the question. More research needed before the armband is confirmed at 6pm on Friday.

- **One's to watch**- Next week to pin in your diary is GW34. It's time to think about putting out a full starting XI all with double fixtures. The spine of that team needs to include Alisson, Estupinan, Mitoma/March, Rashford and Haaland. The rest will decide whether you climb or fall and how much you're willing to gamble.
