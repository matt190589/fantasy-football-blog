Is it just a blip or is this a return to the mean? Man City were on the wrong side of a terrible refereeing decision last Saturday but Haaland also registered his lowest touches in the box in any premier league match that he's started this season. Let's not jump to conclusions as he is still an undeniable threat but other captains can be considered. At the top of this list has to Marcus Rashford has delivered every week since returning from Qatar.

So the revival must start **here**. It is possible to mount a big comeback in the second half of the season. I'll document my weekly choices and upward trajectory on this blog every week.

- **Gameweek 20** it's time to Dis....Mount, transfered in to GW19 for his double game resulted in a late injury to rule him out for the city game. Captain Mitrovic sits out the second
- **Looking forward to Gameweek 20** the profilic goal machine has a double game week which gives him the captaincy armband with a strong case for the Triple captain Chip. Apart from KDB, it's impossible to predict how many city players will play both games so I'm avoiding Pep Roulette and saving my transfers for Spurs or Man United players. Harry Kane loves the North London derby and is fond of scoring against the Champions. On the topic of Spurs assets, has Son found his form after dumping his facemask? In form Shaw seems a shrewd investment for the double game week and beyond.

- **One's to watch** Two words, Brighton players. They are the form team for scoring goals at the minute with March, Mitoma and Ferguson all returning over 1goal or assist per game in their last four. A poor Liverpool performance should not detract from the point scoring opportunities available as Brighton play Leicester, Bournemouth and Fulham in their next games.
