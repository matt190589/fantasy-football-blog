Is it just a blip or is this a return to the mean? Man City were on the wrong side of a terrible refereeing decision last Saturday but Haaland also registered his lowest number of touches in the box in any Premier League match this season. Let's not jump to conclusions as he is still an undeniable threat but other captains can be considered. At the top of this list has to Marcus Rashford who has delivered every week since returning from Qatar.

- **Gameweek 20** Let's begin with the good news. Captain Rashford delivered in controversial circumstances but a solid 24 points lifts this week's score. Avoiding Haaland on the Triple Captain seems to have been a good choice. A double gameweek score of 8 points is a low return for such a prolific player. Another defeat in my head to head league leaves me 14-5 down and with a huge deficit to overturn.

- **Looking forward to Gameweek 21** Leeds begin a good run of games with a possible double game week in GW22. Dodge their defence but Rodrigo and Gnonto are solid attacking options. My transfer plan is a coin flip between penalty-misser Mitovic and a very inconsistent Cucurella who was benched and missed out on a clean sheet against Palace.

- **One's to watch** Two words, Brighton players. They are the form team for scoring goals at the minute with March, Mitoma and Ferguson all returning over 1 goal or assist per game in their last four. A poor Liverpool performance should not detract from the point scoring opportunities available as Brighton play Leicester, Bournemouth and Fulham in their next games.
