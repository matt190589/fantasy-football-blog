As much as I have considered it while languishing at the bottom of so many mini-leagues, I am still managing in the FPL. However, my namesake has joined Atletico Madrid leaving many of his owners in the lurch and he's not the only one. In this post, I'll discuss the January transfer window and how the player movements could make major or minor differences in the next few months.

- **Farewells**- Joao Cancelo's departure is no surprise given his decline in PL minutes. This does open up opportunities for Rico Lewis as a much cheaper alternative. Doherty and Llorente are defenders that also left of deadline day.

- **It's time to Impress**- Gakpo has joined a stuttering Liverpool and isn't of interest just yet. Hitting the ground running is Benoit Badiashile who has already returned 14pts and more importantly stability to the Chelsea defence. The question is whether the Chelsea squad will soar with all the big money spent or will it be a case of sore heads when looking at the bank balance at the end of the season.

- **One's to watch** There are always one or two that emerge from the January transfer window as superb points scorers with Lingard's move to West Ham in January 2021 a prime example of how early manager moves can make the difference. My three to look out for are Mudyrk, Badiashile and Antony Gordon. A final note is to keep an eye out on the three players that Chelsea register for the Champions League. Those unavailable in that competition are almost certain to feature more in the Premier League.
