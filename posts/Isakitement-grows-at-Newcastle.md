A week of the lesser spotted FPL players alongside Arsenal's prolific attack. Alexander Isak's brace fired him into double figures and Saka's top score of the season rewarded many who opted for him as a captain. Walcott doubled his season's score with an impressive performance against Spurs. All thoughts are now fully on GW29.

- **Gameweek 28**- Preparations for my GW27, 28 & 29 teams started a few weeks ago and forward planning has paid off. I gained a 9th green arrow in 10 GWs and climbed 300,000 places. Martinelli had a goal scoring returning as captain with Madison, Watkins and Gnonto all pitching in with assists.

- **Looking forward to GW29**- INCOMING.... AN ALMIGHTY GW! With 12 teams have DGWs, we should all be stacking our teams to have 22 matches or more. However, players such as Kane, Saka and Gabriel are hard to omit given their recent form.

- **One's to watch**- We have plenty of time to think before the next FPL games. Don't go too early on your transfers as injuries and knocks could pop up over the international break.
