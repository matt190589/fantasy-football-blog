A week of the lesser spotted FPL players alongside Arsenal's prolific attack. Alexander Isak's brace fired him into double figures and Saka's top score of the season rewarded many who opted for him as a captain. Walcott doubled his season's score with an impressive performance against Spurs. All thoughts are now fully on GW29.

- **Gameweek 28**- Preparations for my GW27, 28 & 29 teams started a few weeks ago and forward planning has paid off. I gained a 9th green arrow in 10 GWs and climbed 300,000 places. Martinelli had a goal scoring returning as captain with Madison, Watkins and Gnonto all pitching in with assists.

- **Looking forward to GW29**- INCOMING.... AN ALMIGHTY GW! With 12 teams have DGWs, we should all be stacking our teams to have 22 matches or more. However, players such as Kane, Saka and Gabriel are hard to omit given their recent form. Chelsea, Manchester United and Brighton have favourable fixtures but you may want to opt for a West Ham midfielder as a big differential.

- **One's to watch**-Don't go too early on your transfers as injuries and knocks could pop up over the international break. However it's moving week and I've decided to select two players in each position with less 5% ownership that may move you up your mini-leagues. Let's start with defenders; Wan-Bissaka(gaining Ten Haag's favour recently) and Badiashile. On to midfielders where there are many gems available, my two picks are Jarrod Bowen and Rodrigo who picked a goal against Wolves. Finally, the forwards that could make the difference- Ings is first up..when he fires, it's usually a few at a time. The second is Lord Bamford who's points scoring form may be about to soar!
