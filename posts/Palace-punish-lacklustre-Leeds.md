A woeful second half performance by Leeds propelled Jordan Ayew and Olise to the top of the FPL charts this week. At the top of the league, Haaland returned with his usual double figue haul and Martinelli breaking Brazilian records in the Premier League. The big guns are firing and I can only see this continuing for the rest of the season.

- **Gameweek 30**- From such highs to a mini-low. An average captain choice of Rashford and some terrible bench decisions saw my first fall in five weeks. A loss in my H2H league means an overall score of 19 -9 with only 9 to play. I'll take the positives with Haaland and Moreno both having an immediate impact. Lampard's managerial tactics leaves me with many questions around Chilwell. Could be time to move Chilwell and Maddison on!

- **Looking forward to GW31**- Mentioned early in the article, Olise may be an interesting asset with a favourable run of fixtures for Palace. Rashford's injury will keep him out until GW33 but he may be worth holding w

- **One's to watch**- GW32 is a famine closely followed by a feast in GW34. The question is whether to hold DGW players such as Rasford, Grealish, Chilwell, March, Mitoma and more in the hope that 9 or 10 players can get you through GW32. Chelsea have little to offer at the moment so you may wish to switch to Liverpool, Newcastle or Arsenal players in the hope of success.
