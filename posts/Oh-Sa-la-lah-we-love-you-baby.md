After a long, long, long quiet run of form, Salah produced a double digit haul for the first time since GW17. Luke Shaw was benched by many but had a storming week and Monsieur Haaland scored again. He is front runner for the Triple Captain armband in GW28 or GW29. Saka continues to the prime Arsenal player with two games in the week after next.

- **Gameweek 23**- KDB took last week's warning and reacted. This rewarded me to take me to another total of over 70 points. Captain Haaland and Saka's points helped me return my fifth green arrow in a row. My defence is not delivering but not many are currently. The highlight of my week was a comeback draw in my head to head league. This takes the overall score to 16 - 5!

- **Looking forward to GW24 & 25**- Thinking about GW25 is your most strategically important over the next two weeks. Liverpool, Arsenal, Everton and Wolves all have doubles but as important is looking our for the teams that will blank in GW25. Hold all your Arsenal players for now and consider Salah, Robertson and Nunez for the coming two weeks. Not considering GW25, Chelsea's attack may be ready to unleash and Southampton always have 9 nil defeat in them.

- **One's to watch**- Maddison may be back but Leicester face a few difficult matches before Soton in GW26. He's worth tracking. The statistics behind Joao Felix are promising and I'd recommend keeping an eye on him. Brentford's form is not temporary and I expect Toney to continue to be in the goals and points in the next few weeks.
